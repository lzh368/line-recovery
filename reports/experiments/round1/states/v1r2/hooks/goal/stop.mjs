// Goal mode's stop hook: consulted after every Task of a run. Reads the Session's Trace to
// find its GOAL.json and this round's token usage, then either injects the next round's
// protocol message (the host stamps it `sender: "harness"`) or ends the goal.
//
// stdin:  { "hook": "stop", "session_id", "trace_path" }
// stdout: nothing when no goal is live on this Session; otherwise
//         { "decision": "continue", "input": "<next round>", "reason", "output": {…} } or
//         { "decision": "stop", "reason", "output": { status, round, tokens_used, budget } }
//
// The decision, first match wins: the file says complete / blocked → that outcome; the Task
// was cut off (abort, a failure the run gave up on, the max_turns cap — the model never got
// to write the file) → aborted; the wrap-up round just ran → budget_limited; the round cap →
// aborted; the budget is reached → one wrap-up round; otherwise → the next round. Every
// ending is written back with `ended: true` — the model only ever writes `status`, so that
// flag is what tells a goal this run just ended from one that ended on an earlier run (the
// hook stays silent for those). A file that no longer parses ends the goal as blocked and is
// moved aside as GOAL.json.broken.
